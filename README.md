## TileSets

This repo will serve as a collection point for TileSets. TileSets need to be saved to a text file. The name of the file must be `tilesetname_datatype.txt`. For example: `numbers_strings.txt`. Which would contain the following, `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`. The contents must be an even number, split by a comma `,`, and cannot be longer than 14 total entries.

DataTypes can either be `strings` or `images`. If you're using images, you must point to an image on a webserver. Full URL.

If you want to contribute, fork this repo and submit a pull request with your TileSet. Keep it in the `tilesets` folder, or I'll deny it.
